## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("treemapify")
library(treemapify)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(janitor)
library(svglite)
library(grid)
library(dplyr)
spotify_songs <- read.csv("~/Downloads/spotify_songs.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
clean_names(spotify_songs)
```

```{r}
  ggplot(spotify_songs, aes(danceability, valence, color=playlist_genre)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "gray") +
   geom_point(color = "white") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black", color = NA),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black", color = NA),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray30"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray20"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"),
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white"),
   legend.title=element_text(color="white"),
   legend.text = element_text(color="white"),
  plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "white"),
  plot.caption = element_text(color = "white"),
  ) +
   labs(title = "The correlation between valence and danceability in Spotify's most popular songs", subtitle = "Pop, the most visually apparent genre, tends to have a balance between valence and\n danceability, but some songs have low valence and high danceability. On the contrary, Rap\n tends to be more danceable but less upbeat, indicating a lot of rap songs are fun to move to\n but deal with heavier or more serious topics.",
        caption = "Source: Spotify via Kaggle \n by Dylan Jaffe", x = "Danceability", y = "Valence", color="Playlist Genre")+
 geom_point()
```
